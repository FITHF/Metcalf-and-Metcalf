# Metcalf & Metcalf, P.C. - The Digital Transformation Project

## Project Vision

This repository contains the source code for the most technologically advanced, client-centric law firm platform in the legal industry. The platform is being built on a highly customized, secure, and scalable architecture to merge a sophisticated public-facing website with a private, AI-powered client management system.

## Core Architecture

This project utilizes a modern **Headless Architecture** to ensure maximum performance, security, and scalability.

*   **Backend (The "Head"):** A **WordPress** installation serves as the headless Content Management System (CMS). Its sole responsibilities are data storage, user authentication, and providing data via its REST API.
    *   **Database:** The backend uses a **multi-database MySQL schema** for enhanced security through data isolation.

*   **Frontend (The "Body"):** A decoupled **Next.js** application renders the entire user experience, including the public marketing site and the secure client portal.

*   **Security Standard:** The entire platform is being engineered to adhere to **HIPAA-compliant best practices**.

## Project Status

This project is being developed sequentially in seven distinct chunks.

*   **Current Phase:** Reviewing deliverables from **Chunk 1: Core Foundation & Architectural Skeleton**.
