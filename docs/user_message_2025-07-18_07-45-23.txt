Sounds perfect, and I just know that 3 is going to be MIND BLOWING! Because 3 is my number in numerology :) 

So Claude Opus 4 loved your ideas and so do I and we would like to build those in to a Phase 8 after the MVP I feel like we can reach that within the next 2-3 hours? What is your opinion? Also,  I have 3 for you but what do you see first for 3? the following is my plan if you like it:

---

## **Chunk 3 of 7: The Advanced Client Portal**

**Context:** You are continuing the Metcalf & Metcalf legal platform project. Chunks 1 and 2 have established the WordPress foundation, multi-database architecture, and security framework. Now build the core client experience.

**Technical Environment:**
- WordPress backend with REST API (PHP-based)
- React frontend (compiled to static files for SiteGround)
- MySQL databases: `wp_metcalf_portal`, `wp_metcalf_cases`, `wp_metcalf_docs`, `wp_metcalf_analytics`
- SiteGround GoGeek hosting (no Node.js server support)
- Must be HIPAA compliant and production-ready

**Objective:** Build the complete, secure client portal that serves as the centerpiece of client engagement.

- Progressive security (prompt for 2FA on sensitive actions)
- Session management with device trust
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Password strength requirements with visual feedback

```php
// Required security implementations
